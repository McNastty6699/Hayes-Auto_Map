# Hayes-Auto_Map
This is a map i created for my server. It was part of learning phase. I still am learning. but wanted to share with everyone in case they wanted to use it to. 
Just Drag and Drop HayesAuto Folder into your Maps folder and your good to go.
If you do it diffrently you may have to add ensure_HayesAuto to your cfg.
